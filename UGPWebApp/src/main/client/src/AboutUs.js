                            research about any course or professor and how former students of these courses did in the past.

                            We anticipated the summer of 2020 to be an exciting stage of our careers as we hoped to land an internship and start working on real life projects to gain some valuable experience. However, due to the unforeseen circumstances of COVID-19, we were left with having to shift gears in a different direction. So, we decided to become a team and work on an impactful project that would not only be useful for us but others. Thus, the idea of GradePal was originated.

                            As students, we do our due diligence before registering for any course for an upcoming semester. 
                            Although UIC has a grade distribution website of its own, interacting with it is overly intricate. 
                            For very reason, we wanted to create an application which will be beneficial for any UIC student to do 
                            their research for any course or a professor. Whether that be by simply filtering geneds by credit hours 
                            or by leaving reviews for professors for other students to read.
