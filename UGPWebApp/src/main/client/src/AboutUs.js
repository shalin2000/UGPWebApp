                            To ease up every semester's course scheduling for students by creating a virtual hub for them to research about any course or professor and how former students did in those courses

						<p>
                        Ourselves, as being students do some intense research before registering for any courses for an upcoming semester. We wanted to make an application and utilize its features to make our and other student's research easier and effortless. Although UIC has a grade distribution website of it's own, it is overly intricate to interact with. For very reason, we wanted to create an application which will be useful for any UIC college student to do their research for any course.
