                            research about any course or professor and how students perform in those courses.

						<p> 
                            We anticipated the summer of 2020 to be an exciting stage of our careers as we hoped to land an internship and start working on real life projects to gain some useful experience. However, due to the unforeseen circumstances of COVID-19, we were left with having to shift gears in a different direction. So, we decided to become a team and work on an impactful project that would not only be useful for us but others. Thus, GradePal was made.
                        </p>

                            As students, we do our due diligence before registering for any course for an upcoming semester. 
                            Although UIC has a grade distribution website of its own, interacting with it is overly complicated. 
                            For very reason, we wanted to create an application which will be useful for any UIC student to do 
                            their research for any course or a professor. Whether that be by simply filtering geneds by credit hours 
                            or by leaving reviews for professors for other students to read.
