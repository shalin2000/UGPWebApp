                            As we wrapped up our school year, our team anticipated that summer 2020 would be an exciting new stage for our careers. 
                            We were actively seeking internships and hoping to develop our professional skillsets by gaining valuable real-world experience. However, the unforeseen 
                            circumstances of COVID-19 resulted in a change of plans. We decided to shift gears and work on an impactful project ourselves as a team.
                            This led to the idea of GradePal, a service intended to revolutionize course selection and research for UIC students.

                            Most UIC students prefer to do their due diligence before registering for any courses for an upcoming semester. 
                            Although UIC has their own grade distribution website of its own, many current students have found it to beÂ unintuitive to navigate. 
                            For this very reason, we wanted to create an application which would help UIC students learn about their courses and instructors easily and efficiently.

                            We hope our website will have a positive impact, 
                            not just by assisting us with our professional development, but by providing a positive user experience to everyone 
                            who takes advantage of this service.
